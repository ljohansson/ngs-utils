Picard_name,Nice_name,Description
samples,Samples,External sample name
Pipeline_finished,Date pipeline finished,Moment when last step finished (or started)
Overall_concordance,Concordance,Fraction of SNPs that are concordant between array and NGS
MEAN_BAIT_COVERAGE,Mean bait coverage,Mean coverage of all baits
MEAN_TARGET_COVERAGE,Mean target coverage,Mean coverage of targets with coverage >= 2
Fraction bp near bait,Fraction bp near bait,Fraction bp near bait (+/- 250 bp)
Capture specificity,Capture specificity,Capture specificity; 1 - fraction bases that is off bait
PCT_TARGET_BASES_2X,Fraction target covered >= 2x,Percentage of ALL target bases with coverage >= 2
PCT_TARGET_BASES_10X,Fraction target covered >= 10x,Percentage of ALL target bases with coverage >= 10
PCT_TARGET_BASES_20X,Fraction target covered >= 20x,Percentage of ALL target bases with coverage >= 20
PCT_TARGET_BASES_30X,Fraction target covered >= 30x,Percentage of ALL target bases with coverage >= 30
PCT_USABLE_BASES_ON_TARGET,Fraction usable bases on target,"Fraction of aligned, deduplicated, on-target bases out of the PF bases available"
TOTAL_READS,Total number of reads,Total number of reads including all PF and non-PF reads
PCT_PF_UQ_READS_ALIGNED,Fraction reads aligned (UQ?!),Fraction of PF unique reads that are aligned with alignment score > 0 to the reference genome
PERCENT_DUPLICATION,Fraction duplicates,Fraction of aligned read pairs that is marked as duplicate. A read pair that is marked as duplicate is aligned to exactly the same location as another read pair that is not marked as duplicate. Two reads that align to the same location may have (some) different nucleotides.
MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE,Median insert size,"Median of the insert sizes, where insert refers to the base pairs between the adapters."
MEAN_INSERT_SIZE,Mean insert size,"Mean of the insert sizes, where insert refers to the base pairs between the adapters."
STANDARD_DEVIATION,Standard deviation insert size,"Standard deviation of the insert sizes, where insert refers to the base pairs between the adapters."
STRAND_BALANCE,Strand balance,Number of PF reads aligned to the positive strand of the genome divided by the number of PF reads aligned to the genome
MEAN_READ_LENGTH,Mean read length,Mean read length of the set of reads examined
GENOME_SIZE,Genome size (bp),Number of bases in the reference genome used for alignment
BAIT_TERRITORY,Bait size (bp),Number of bases which have one or more baits on top of them
TARGET_TERRITORY,Target size (bp),Unique number of target bases in the experiment where target is usually exons etc
BAIT_SET,Bait set,Name of the bait set used in the hybrid selection
nSNPs,Number of SNPs for concordance,
PF_UQ_BASES_ALIGNED,Aligned bases (Mb),Number of bases in the PF aligned reads that are aligned to the reference genome. Accounts for clipping and gaps (=indels?)
